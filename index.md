## Full stack developer and Student

Hello, I'm software developer with six months of work experience. I started programing since 2012, and currently I studying Systems and Computing Engineering in the Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Specifically, I have worked with this languages and libraries: Java, C, C++ (Cuda), Python (Keras, enunpy), Verilog, VHDL, (HTML/CSS), JQuery, Ajax, PHP, Mysql, Java (JEE, Swing,), SQLite 3, Postgres, Ruby, Ruby on rails (Device, Gmaps4Rails, CarrierWave, Bootstrap4).

I'm learning Hibernate and Spring making a project. I recently developed an application for the management of samples in biological laboratories.

Although, I'm an autodidact, I acquired a large part of my knowledge in the laboratories and practices of the University.
